# CodeNation-MasterCourse-Calculator

A calculator web app build with React and MathJS for the master course week 5

The project is live at [https://frabjous-selkie-20af8d.netlify.app/](https://frabjous-selkie-20af8d.netlify.app/)

Here's some of the stuff I got working in this project:

* Using components, hooks, modules, event listener and event dispatcher
* Neumorphic style design elements
* Parsing the expression and replacing symbols for actual functions, adding missing opening parenthesis
* Displaying the original expression (for user's benefit) while getting the result value from the changed and valid expression
* Keeps the last valid result visible while the expression is incomplete (just after an operator is pressed)
* Binding the keys corresponding to the buttons and delegating the key press to the buttons click events
* Catching, validating and handling errors
* Slowly cycling backgrounds

## Getting Started with Create React App
<details>
<summary>Click here for details.</summary>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
